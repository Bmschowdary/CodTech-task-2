Overview of the Code:
This Python program is a "Student Grade Tracker" application built using the Tkinter library for GUI. The application allows users to input grades for eight different subjects and then calculates the overall grade, corresponding letter grade, and GPA (Grade Point Average). It also includes error handling for invalid inputs and displays appropriate messages for invalid grades.

Key Components of the Code:
1. Imports: 
   - Tkinter is used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
   - Messagebox is used for displaying error dialogs.

2. Class GradeTracker:
   - The core of the application is encapsulated in this class, which manages the window, grade entries, and computations.
   - Attributes:
     - root: The main window of the application.
     - grades: A dictionary to store grades for each subject.
     - subjects: A list of subject names.
     - entries: A dictionary to store the entry widgets for each subject.
   
3. Interface Setup:
   - A loop is used to create `Label` widgets for each subject and corresponding `Entry` widgets for user input.
   - A "Calculate Overall Grade" button is placed below the subject fields. When clicked, it triggers the `calculate_overall_grade()` method.
   - A `Label` widget is used to display the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA.

4. Method `calculate_overall_grade():
   - This method collects the grades from the entry fields, validates them, and computes the overall grade.
   - It checks that each grade is a number between 0 and 100. If invalid input is detected, an error message is shown.
   - Once all grades are validated, the overall grade is calculated as the average of all subject grades.
   - It then calculates the letter grade and GPA by calling helper methods (`get_letter_grade()` and `get_gpa()`), which map the grade to a corresponding letter and GPA value.
   - The results are displayed using the `overall_label`.

5. Helper Methods:
   - `get_letter_grade(grade)`: Converts the numerical grade to a letter grade based on predefined thresholds.
   - `get_gpa(grade)`: Converts the numerical grade to a GPA (on a scale of 0 to 10).

6. Running the Application:
   - The `run()` method starts the main event loop of the Tkinter application.

Example Workflow:
1. The user enters grades for each subject in the provided input fields.
2. Upon clicking "Calculate Overall Grade", the program validates the input.
3. If all inputs are valid, the program calculates and displays the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA.
4. If an input is invalid (e.g., a non-numeric value or a grade outside the range of 0-100), an error message appears.

Error Handling:
- Invalid Grade Values: If a user enters a value outside the 0-100 range, an error dialog is shown.
- Non-Numeric Inputs: If the user enters a non-numeric value, an error message is displayed.

Example Usage:
- A teacher or student can use this tool to quickly calculate their overall academic performance by entering individual subject grades.

Dependencies:
- Tkinter is required, which is part of the Python standard library, so no external installations are necessary.

Extension Ideas:
- Add functionality to save grades to a file.
- Allow the user to input custom subject names.
- Expand GPA scale customization based on different academic systems.
